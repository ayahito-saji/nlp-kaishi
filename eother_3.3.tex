\section{Introduction}

In late years importance of a study of a theory/algorithm system 
about language processing rises\cite{Article_01}. 
A study of this field of our country has already had the history 
more than 30 years, 
and presentation of the results of the study increases rapidly. 
Importance of individual sex and a language processing study from a situation 
in consideration of universality to have of a language increases, 
and linguistics, a researcher of comp-sci are common, 
and an arguing place is demanded\cite{Book_02}. 
Similar situation has it in U.S.A., Europe, Asian countries. 
There is The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) led by U.S.A., 
and European Chapter of ACL is prepared into Europe and works on I am active each. 
In view of such situation\cite{Inproc_03}, 
we established `The Association for Natural Language Processing (NLP)' 
again as a place of international study interchange as 
a place of results of research announcement of language disposal of 
our country on April 1, 1994\cite{Masters_04,Techrep_05}. 
And I did the activity object range with making fate, 
an aim clear as follows to form a society as the place 
where a high argument was possible of density\nocite{Web_06}.
